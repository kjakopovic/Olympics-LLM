                        Origins and History of the Olympic Games
                    </h1>

                    <p>The roots of the Olympic Games trace back to ancient Greece, where they were first held in 776 BCE in Olympia. These ancient Games were religious and athletic festivals held in honor of Zeus, featuring events such as running, wrestling, and chariot racing. The Games were discontinued in 393 CE but were revived in the modern era thanks to the efforts of Pierre de Coubertin, a French educator and historian who founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The first modern Olympic Games took place in Athens, Greece, in 1896, symbolizing a link between ancient traditions and contemporary global sports.</p>
