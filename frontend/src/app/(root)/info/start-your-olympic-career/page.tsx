                        1. Meeting Sporting Standards and Qualifications
                    </h1>

                    <p>Each discipline in the Olympic Games has strictly defined qualification standards that athletes must meet. These standards are set by international sports federations governing specific sports and include:</p>
                    
                    <ul
                        className='text-left mt-3 mb-3'
                    >
                        <li><strong>Performance Standards:</strong> Athletes must achieve minimum results, such as specific times in running, heights in jumping, or scores in gymnastics, at competitions recognized by international sports organizations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Qualification Tournaments:</strong> In many sports, such as boxing, tennis, or team sports, athletes must pass through qualification tournaments at regional, continental, or world levels.</li>
                        <li><strong>World Ranking:</strong> In sports like tennis or golf, the international federationâ€™s rankings determine which players qualify for the Olympic Games.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For instance, in athletics, there are "A" and "B" standards. Athletes who meet the "A" standard automatically qualify, while those with the "B" standard depend on quotas and additional conditions.</p>

                        2. Affiliation with a National Olympic Committee (NOC)
                    </h1>

                    <p>Athletes can apply to the Olympic Games exclusively through their National Olympic Committee (NOC). This means that:</p>
                    
                    <ul
                        className='text-left mt-3 mb-3'
                    >
                        <li>The athlete must be a citizen of the country they represent.</li>
                        <li>They must have the support of the national sports organization overseeing their sport.</li>
                        <li>The athlete must be registered with the international federation for their sport.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>National Olympic Committees play a crucial role in the application process as they coordinate national qualifications, select teams, and compile the necessary documentation for the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</p>
